/**
 * 1. For code to run, we need a main function.
 * 2. main returns an integer (indicating the status of the execution).
 * 3. We use {} to delineate the beginning and ending (aka the scope) of things.
 * 4. We must end statements with ;
 * 5. Printing is not part of the C++ language
 *    Instead, it belongs to the std library and we need to include it.
